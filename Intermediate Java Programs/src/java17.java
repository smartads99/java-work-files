    //Future Investment Value
    /*
The future value calculator calculates the future value (FV) of an investment for a series of regular deposits, on a set rate of interest (r), and the number of years (t).

You must use the mathematical formula:

A = PMT ((1+r/n)^nt – 1) / (r/n))

(The formula assumes the deposits are made at the end of each period such as month or year).

A = Future Value of the Investment
PMT = Payment amount for each period
n = Number of compounds per period
t = Number of periods the money is invested

For example, you deposit Rs 10,000 per month (The deposit is made at the end of each month) at an interest rate of 8% compounded monthly. (This is 12 compounds per period). You may calculate the value of the investment after 10 years as follows:

PMT = Rs 10,000
n = 12 (Number of compounds per period is 12 for monthly compounding)
t = 10 years

A = (10,000(((1+0.08/12)^(120) – 1) / (0.08/12)))
A = Rs 18,29,460.
